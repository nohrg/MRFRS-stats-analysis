Statistical analysis for a cat shelter. Phase 1 Project for DS 5500 Fall 2025

Merrimack River Feline Rescue Society, a cat shelter based in Salisbury MA, wants to know which of its event types has been most successful at getting cats adopted, as well as any patterns in successful (and unsuccessful) applications from potential adopters. Most of what they've worked off of has been gut feeling, rather than getting their decisions supported by their own data.

Using their data from 2021 to the present, I intend to answer their questions and hypotheses around two topics: adoption demographic and success patterns, and cat outcomes. This will be done primarily with traditional statistical analysis and turned into a report for the MRFRS staff. I will consider the project successful if I can provide effective and expressive visualizations and analysis for the major questions of each topic.
